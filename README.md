Apple.com clone web app that is built using React.js and Node.js

Description
For the back end, I used Express for my server and MySql for my database. My REST-API is serving the iphone page from the database.

For the front end, I wanted to make the current apple.com better by using a third party API from Google Cloud, specifically youTube, and incorporating it to the website, so anyone can have access to Apple's youTube channel straight from the website.
